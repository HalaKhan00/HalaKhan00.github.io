Hi! I’m **Hala**, a Biomedical Engineering grad student at UNIST.  
I work on **AI for bioimaging** — virtual staining, explainability, and deep generative models for pathology.

- Currently: multiplex virtual staining via neural representations (ViT + generative models)
- Interests: uncertainty & trust maps, fluorescence ↔︎ brightfield translation, ECG GANs
- Tools: PyTorch, CUDA, MATLAB, Python, VS Code
